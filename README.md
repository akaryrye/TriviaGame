# TriviaGame

Built with HTML, CSS, JQuery, and bootstrap, this is a movie themed trivia game.  I created this as practice project to better learn the setTimeout/setInterval methods in Javascript.  It isn't perfect, nor particularly beautiful, but I had fun creating it and I hope you enjoy playing with it!.

To begin, simply click or press any key.  You have only a few seconds to answer the questions, so hurry up, lest you be admonished by former president Barak Obama.

Thank you and I hope you enjoyed this app!
