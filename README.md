# TriviaGame

#### About:
Built with , this is a movie themed trivia game.  I created this as practice project to better learn the setTimeout/setInterval methods in Javascript.  Begin by clicking or pressing any key.  You have only a few seconds to answer the questions, so hurry up, lest you be admonished by former president Barak Obama.
